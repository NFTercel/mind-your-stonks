## The Story
[BET.co.za](https://bet.co.za) does not have an easier way to track the changes in the account balance. All that it displays is the current account balance. In order to get an idea of how much you have deposited/lost in your account, you have to sift through pages of transaction history which is a bit noisy.
The purpose of this project is to allow [bet.co.za](https://bet.co.za) clients to keep track of the changes in their account balance.
