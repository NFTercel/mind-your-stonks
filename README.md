## The Story
[BET.co.za](https://bet.co.za) does not have an easier way to track the changes in the 'invester's account balance. All that it displays is the current account balance. In order to get an idea of how much you have deposited/lost in your account, you have to sift through lots and lots of pages on the transaction history, not to mention the brutal experience the 'investor' will have to go through to compute the account's balance at a particular moment in time from all that information.

The purpose of this project is to provide [bet.co.za](https://bet.co.za) clients an easier way to keep track of the changes occurring in their account balance.

Basically there are utility scripts that run and log into the client's [BET.CO.ZA](https://bet.co.za) account (using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and read the value of the current balance and uploads the data to a [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/), where then it can be visualized.
